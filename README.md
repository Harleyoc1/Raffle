# Raffle
A Java program demonstrating simple use of Switches, and the Buffered Reader for standard input.

## Buffered Reader
A Buffered Reader example can be seen in `src/main/java/com/harleyocnnor/raffle/utils/BufferedInputUtils.java`, where it's stored in the static variable `STD_IN_READER`, and used multiple times in the functions of that class to read from standard input.  

## Switch
A simple example of a switch can be seen in `src/main/java/com/harleyocnnor/raffle/Raffle.java` on line `50`.
